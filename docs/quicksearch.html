Parameters: Name Type Default Description stop number 1 the number of delay iterations. This is would be in seconds if delay is 1000 millis. arg Object null an object that should be returned by the callback when the wait is complete. delay number 1000 the number of millis to pause per stop. Returns: a Javascript promise object Type Promise waitCallback(stop, cb, arg, delay) Uses the timeout function to create a pause in a function without stopping the event loop. The default without any parameters is a 1 second pause. When the timeout ends a callback is executed and it receives the arg parameter to be used in the callback. Parameters: Name Type Default Description stop number 1 the number of delay iterations. This is would be in seconds if delay is 1000 millis. cb function null a callback function that is executed when the timeout is complete. arg Object null an object that should be returned by the callback when the wait is complete. delay number 1000 the number of millis to pause per stop. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.3 on February 26th 2017, 2:11:36 pm using the DocStrap template. "},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" Documentation Global waitwaitCallback util.wait Javascript pause/wait functions This library contains two functions: wait - JavaScript function that returns a Promise and can be used in a thenable chain to delay for N iterations of S seconds. waitCallback - JavaScript function that uses a callback after N iterations of S seconds. These two functions are used to create a delay in processing without stopping the event loop. It does this by using a wrapped Timeout call. The functions rely on the processing of a Promise or a callback to do this. InstallationTo install as a global package: $ npm install --global util.waitTo install as an application dependency: $ npm install --save util.waitTo build the app and run all tests: $ npm run allUsagewaitCallback(3, (val: any) =&gt; { // continuation after 3 second wait. The val is passed to the callback // after time has expired. In this example the string 'stuff' is // passed. }, 'stuff');This wait function will pause for N sections and use a callback function on completion. The example shows that at the end of 3 seconds it is called to complete the wait. const wait = require('util.wait').wait; wait(3, 'something') .then((val: any) =&gt; { // continuation after 3 second wait the val is the value passed // to then after time has expired. In this example it would // pass the string 'something' }) .catch((err: string) =&gt; { console.error(err); });This version calls wait with a Promise object returned that can be chained together using then (thenable). This is just a wrapper on around the first function to make it thenable. The use case for this is within test cases that use other promises where a delay is beneficial to wait some amount of time for async operations to finish in the test (such as testing a timed interval and its results). × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.3 on February 26th 2017, 2:11:36 pm using the DocStrap template.
